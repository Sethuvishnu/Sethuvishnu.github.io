In my YouTube Sentiment Analysis project, I leveraged data science techniques, including Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and the YouTube API, to analyze comments on YouTube videos. The goal was to determine the sentimentâ€”whether the comments were positive, negative, or neutral. By applying NLTK for natural language processing and utilizing the YouTube API for data extraction, the project aimed to provide insights into the overall sentiment of the YouTube community's responses. This allowed for a nuanced understanding of audience reactions and engagement with the content.


NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit, and it is a powerful library in Python for working with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to perform tasks such as tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more. NLTK is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning applications.
